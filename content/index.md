Developer that spaces from web-sites/apps to desktop applications and smarthphone apps.

I really love to start interesting adventures studying new (for me) languages and coding techniques, so, every time there's the chance, I try to design new ways of implementing my code, because there is always a better way to do things or at least a smarter one.
